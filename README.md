# Project Presentation Rubric	                                                    

Motivate and define the problem:	                                                                              20

Briefly mention related work:	                                                                                  20

Explain at least one the main ideas of your project clearly:	                                                  20

Show a draft of Figure 1, a visual representation of the main idea:	                                            10

Explain planned experiments or show results. Try to explain what we might learn from these experiments:	        20

Finish under time (5 minutes):	                                                                                10

Please treat this task like an exam and make sure to allocate time to prepare your presentation and work on your project this week. The project presentation weighs 10% of your final mark in the course.

If you’re not very far along in your project yet, don’t panic! The presentation is about explaining your ideas clearly and concisely, and is only 5 minutes long. If you don’t yet have results to show, simply explaining what you’re planning to do and why is 100% OK.

# How people interact with each other

We think about speech when we think about communication but there are many factors which affects our interaction with others.

1. Facial expressions.
2. Gestures.
3. Pointing / Using hands.
4. Writing.
5. Drawing.
6. Using equipment e.g. Text message or computer.
7. Touch.
8. Eye contact.

# How people treat each other and their memories of previous interactions

Memory supports and enables social interactions in a variety of ways. In order to engage in successful social interaction, people must be able to remember how they should interact with one another, whom they have interacted with previously, and what occurred during those interactions. Failure in any of these areas can lead to social rejection or violent conflict, which can be detrimental to a person's well being.

 # How this model is similar to Prisoner's Dilemma
 
 ## Prisoner's Dilemma: 
The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so.
