Please treat this task like an exam and make sure to allocate time to prepare your presentation and work on your project this week. The project presentation weighs 10% of your final mark in the course.

If you’re not very far along in your project yet, don’t panic! The presentation is about explaining your ideas clearly and concisely, and is only 5 minutes long. If you don’t yet have results to show, simply explaining what you’re planning to do and why is 100% OK.
