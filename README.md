# ENGG3130_Final_Project PsychoPy
### Modelling people's interactions with each other based on how they treat each other and their memories of previous interactions with each other and how that affects the system as a whole.


# Project Presentation Rubric	                                                    

Motivate and define the problem:	                                                                              20

Briefly mention related work:	                                                                                  20

Explain at least one the main ideas of your project clearly:	                                                  20

Show a draft of Figure 1, a visual representation of the main idea:	                                            10

Explain planned experiments or show results. Try to explain what we might learn from these experiments:	        20

Finish under time (5 minutes):	                                                                                10

Please treat this task like an exam and make sure to allocate time to prepare your presentation and work on your project this week. The project presentation weighs 10% of your final mark in the course.

If you’re not very far along in your project yet, don’t panic! The presentation is about explaining your ideas clearly and concisely, and is only 5 minutes long. If you don’t yet have results to show, simply explaining what you’re planning to do and why is 100% OK.

# How people interact with each other

We think about speech when we think about communication but there are many factors which affects our interaction with others.

1. Facial expressions.
2. Gestures.
3. Pointing / Using hands.
4. Writing.
5. Drawing.
6. Using equipment e.g. Text message or computer.
7. Touch.
8. Eye contact.

# How people treat each other and their memories of previous interactions

Memory supports and enables social interactions in a variety of ways. In order to engage in successful social interaction, people must be able to remember how they should interact with one another, whom they have interacted with previously, and what occurred during those interactions. Failure in any of these areas can lead to social rejection or violent conflict, which can be detrimental to a person's well being.

 # How this model is similar to Prisoner's Dilemma
 
 ## Prisoner's Dilemma: 
The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so.

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

- If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
- If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice versa)
- If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

This represent a variety of interactions where agents have to choose whether to "cooperate" with each other or "defect", and where the reward (or punishment) for each agent depends on what the other chooses. 

With this set of punishments, it is tempting to say that the players should cooperate, that is, that both should remain silent. But neither agent knows what the other will do, so each has to consider two possible outcomes. First, looking at it from A's point of view:

- If B remains silent, A is better off defecting; she would go free rather than serve 1 year.
- If B defects, A is still better off defecting; she would serve only 2 years rather than 3.

No matter what B does, A is better off defecting. And because the game is symmetric, this analysis is the same from B's point of view: no matter what A does, B is better off defecting.

In the simplest version of this game, we assume that A and B have no other considerations to take into account. They can't communicate with each other, so they can't negotiate, make promises, or threaten each other. And they consider only the immediate goal of minimizing their sentences; they don't take into account any other factors.

Under those assumptions, the rational choice for both agents is to defect. That might be a good thing, at least for purposes of criminal justice. But for the prisoners, it is frustrating because there is, apparently, nothing they can do to achieve the outcome they both want. And this model applies to other scenarios in real life where cooperation would be better for the greater good as well as for the players.

## PsychoPy:
Our model of PsycoPy is very much similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma described above. Here, instead of prisoners
